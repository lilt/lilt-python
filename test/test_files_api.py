    LILT API

    LILT API Support: https://lilt.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals    The LILT API enables programmatic access to the full-range of LILT backend services including:   * Training of and translating with interactive, adaptive machine translation   * Large-scale translation memory   * The Lexicon (a large-scale termbase)   * Programmatic control of the LILT CAT environment   * Translation memory synchronization  Requests and responses are in JSON format. The REST API only responds to HTTPS / SSL requests.  The base url for this REST API is `https://api.lilt.com/`.  ## Authentication  Requests are authenticated via API key, which requires the Business plan.  Requests are authenticated using [HTTP Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Add your API key as both the `username` and `password`.  For development, you may also pass the API key via the `key` query parameter. This is less secure than HTTP Basic Auth, and is not recommended for production use.  ## Quotas  Our services have a general quota of 4000 requests per minute. Should you hit the maximum requests per minute, you will need to wait 60 seconds before you can send another request. 

    The version of the OpenAPI document: v3.0.1
