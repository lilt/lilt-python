    LILT API

    LILT API Support: https://lilt.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals    The LILT API enables programmatic access to the full-range of LILT backend services including:   * Training of and translating with interactive, adaptive machine translation   * Large-scale translation memory   * The Lexicon (a large-scale termbase)   * Programmatic control of the LILT CAT environment   * Translation memory synchronization  Requests and responses are in JSON format. The REST API only responds to HTTPS / SSL requests.  The base url for this REST API is `https://api.lilt.com/`.  ## Authentication  Requests are authenticated via API key, which requires the Business plan.  Requests are authenticated using [HTTP Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Add your API key as both the `username` and `password`.  For development, you may also pass the API key via the `key` query parameter. This is less secure than HTTP Basic Auth, and is not recommended for production use.  ## Quotas  Our services have a general quota of 4000 requests per minute. Should you hit the maximum requests per minute, you will need to wait 60 seconds before you can send another request.
